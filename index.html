            <p>Linux has been making waves in the operating system world. By 2027 it is expected that the global Linux market would reach $15.64 trillion dollars and command usage among nearly half of professional developers. This technology is also expected to be a core pillar in powering world’s fastest computers. So, if you’re not using Linux, you are missing out big time because it is the future of the IoT market.
                For this reason, I have compiled a list of the top 7 best Linux distro to watch out for in the year 2025.

            <p>You couldn’t agree less that Zorin OS 17.2 which is the latest version in the Zorin OS 17 series has beyond doubt proven to be impressive after its release. Since its release on 19 September 2024. It has been performing excellently. With over half a million downloads within the first two month after release. This shows Zorin commitment to bring the power of Linux to the benefit of all.
                Some added functionalities of Zorin 17.2 were; Additional theming options allowing users to change cursor theme. Newer Pre-installed apps meaning lesser need for app download, Built-in support for Flatpak, Applmage and snap packages to enable users get latest version of app for years to come.
